3, Wake and Milk Feed, , Depending on the last time your little one was fed, this first feed of the day might be a big one. Make sure to take note if your baby is not super hungry —this might be a sign that you can start to cut back on feeding in the middle of the night (yay!). For those breastfeeding, you'll probably be very full in the morning, particularly after a long stretch of rest and not feeding. Consider pumping off extra milk to store for later, after you've fed your baby.
3, Naptime, , Someone's feeling a bit sleepy! Don't be surprised if your baby needs a nap before this time, two hours awake might be too long for your little one at this time in the morning. Just keep an eye on how long they nap —too long might mean that they don't get enough to eat during the day, making them hungrier at night. 
3, Milk Feed, , Time for food! Feed your baby upon awakening, who may not wake up for another half an hour or so. Your baby might be still falling asleep at the breast or the bottle at this stage and that's fine!
3, Naptime, , Let your little one recharge for another 30 minutes if they don't wake up on their own.
3, Milk Feed, , Feeding time has come (again) —this may not happen for another half an hour, when baby awakes.
3, Naptime, , Babies are like cats with their naps, sometimes only needing 15-40 minutes at this time (or a little longer if they want)... let your little one sleep for another 30 minutes if they don't wake up on their own at this time. Your baby might even fit in another cat nap before bedtime if the naps were short.
3, Milk Feed, , Wakey wakey. Time to be fed!
3, Bathtime, , It's up to you to decide if a bath feels right at this time of day. If your little one is happy and relaxed, great! But if it stresses you or your baby out, maybe try bathing at a different time of the day, or not every day. 
3, Last Milk Feed, , Your little one is at the age where you can start thinking about trying to keep them from falling asleep at the bottle or breast. Maybe break up the feed and bedtime with a song or story to create some positive sleep associations. But if your baby is still falling asleep at the breast or bottle, don't worry about it-we can focus on that in a month or so!
3, Bedtime, , Time for bed. Sweet Dreams!
