With naps and nighttime sleep combined, your baby will now be likely sleeping a total of 14 to 16 hours a day, and is ready for a sleep schedule and bedtime routine to be introduced \u2013 although it\u2019s never a bad time to start a bedtime routine with your baby! As you begin to create a bedtime routine, test out various calming activities to see what works for the two of you \u2013 it\u2019s important that you also feel relaxed during this routine. Make sure you create plenty of space for this bedtime routine, helping baby to wind down before you lay them in their crib. You can also remove pacifiers from their crib so they\u2019ll be encouraged to soothe themselves if they wake up. ",

        "description": "Although your baby\u2019s naptimes will fluctuate between 4 and 6 months, they\u2019ll likely be consistently logging 2 to 4 hours of total sleep during the day. It\u2019s common for a 4-5 month old baby to have 3 naps each day, while a 6 month old will likely have 2 longer naps each day. At this age, it is now appropriate to begin sleep training, if you so desire. To do this, put your baby down to sleep when they\u2019re showing signs of sleepiness, but are not yet asleep.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be surprised if you hear some tears, as your baby may struggle as they learn to sleep without your presence. Give them some time, then come back in to check on them, and confirm that they\u2019ve found sleep. It\u2019s crucial during sleep training for your baby to be put to bed in a crib, instead of your bed, or a bedside bassinet, so your\u00a06 month old baby can have the space to move around and explore their sleeping environment. This transition can be tricky for both of you, but with time your baby will become comfortable with this new sleeping arrangement, and both of you will gain some autonomy. Now is also the time to remove movement from naps. So, while naps in the car and stroller may still be inevitable it\u2019s important to strive to have your baby\u2019s naps occur in their crib. The crib should be a quiet, safe, and cozy space for baby to recharge. ",

        "description": "Creating a reliable sleep/eat/wake routine adds stability in your little one\u2019s life by helping them know when to expect food, sleep, and play time. A full night of sleep, which consists of 11-12 hours of sleep for a baby this age, should now be the norm. And, this full night of sleep should also be occurring with few nighttime feedings. To help baby achieve this full night of sleep, without needing to wake to feed, ensure they\u2019re receiving a minimum of 24 ounces of nourishment daily, with 5-8 ounces in each feeding. For exclusively breastfed babies, you can ensure they\u2019re receiving enough by feeding them at least 5 times a day for 15-20 minutes. If you\u2019re uncertain about the amount of milk your baby is receiving in each feeding, you can check the amount of milk you produce while pumping. If you\u2019re wondering when your baby can start eating solids, The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends baby only consume breast milk, or formula, for the first 4-6 months. So if they haven\u2019t started solids yet, now is the time to start.",

On the flipside, make it clear that daytime is for fun and games. Try and have those daytime feedings in a well-lit room and you can start to encourage some playtime after a feed. Plus, be sure they\u2019re getting exposed to some sunlight. \u00a0At this age, you can still use a bassinet or a swaddle to help your baby sleep, day or night. ",

At this age, babies should also be transitioned into a crib, rather than with you in your bed or in a bassinet. It may be tough to part ways with your baby in this way, but you want to help them understand their own space and surroundings, which means that they\u2019re not always going to be right next to you. It\u2019s okay to have your baby taking naps in the stroller, the car, or on the go by some other means, but you\u2019ll want to make sure to eliminate all motion from nap and sleep times at around 6 months, by making sure that most sleep happens in the crib.

Your baby should be getting comfortable sleeping through the night (a full 11-12 hours) without a feed. Make sure your baby is getting all the food they need during the day, by getting a minimum of 24 ounces total, with 5-8 ounces per feed. That obviously may be tricky to track if you\u2019re nursing exclusively, but if you are feeding actively for 15-20 minutes, 5x a day, you\u2019re probably getting just the right amount. If you\u2019re concerned, another great way to double check is to see how much milk you can produce during a given time while pumping. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusively breastfeeding or formula feeding for the first 4-6 months, recognizing that infants often are developmentally ready to accept solids between 4-6 months. That said, it\u2019s ultimately up to you and your baby!

Although your baby is not able to consciously comprehend why they need so much sleep, their physical and mental development help to push them in the direction of slumber. \u00a0Significant milestones also begin to occur during this time, such as learning to crawl or stand. While these milestones are exciting, they might also throw a wrench in your baby\u2019s sleep. The best way to help your baby manage these sleep disruptions is through consistency. Be aware though, your baby may quickly realize that this is a game \u2014 if they stand up, and your response is to rush in and sit them down, they\u2019ll know to continue to do that. Avoid this game by showing them how to sit down (instead of just picking them up) and giving them the time and space to figure it out on their own and offer plenty of opportunities throughout the day for them to explore their new skills. Lots of practice during the day should make these milestones no big deal.\u00a0",

It may be tough to part ways with your baby in this way, but you want to help them understand their own space and surroundings, which means that they\u2019re not always going to be right next to you. It\u2019s okay to have your baby taking naps in the stroller, the car, or on the go by some other means, but you\u2019ll want to make sure to eliminate all motion from nap and sleep times at around 6 months, by making sure that most sleep happens in the crib. You can sort of think of the crib as a little sanctuary of open space for your baby \u2014 you want it to be a place where they\u2019re able to move freely and sleep peacefully.",

Your baby should be getting comfortable sleeping through the night (a full 11-12 hours) without a feed. Make sure your baby is getting all the food they need during the day, by getting a minimum of 24 ounces total, with 5-8 ounces per feed. That obviously may be tricky to track if you\u2019re nursing exclusively, but if you are feeding actively for 15-20 minutes, 5x a day, you\u2019re probably getting just the right amount. If you\u2019re concerned, another great way to double check is to see how much milk you can produce during a given time while pumping. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusively breastfeeding or formula feeding for the first 4-6 months, recognizing that infants often are developmentally ready to accept solids between 4-6 months. That said, it\u2019s ultimately up to you and your baby! You know their feeding habits better than anyone, and can probably sense by the way they\u2019re eating, whether or not they\u2019ll welcome solid foods at 6 months (or perhaps even earlier).",

For this reason, there may be less confusion between nighttime and daytime for your little one. Total sleep between naps and bedtime will fall between 14 and 16 hours, and you\u2019re welcome to introduce a sleep schedule and a bedtime routine at this age. (It\u2019s never too early to have your baby getting used to a routine before bed.) Try out different calming activities and see how the two of you feel \u2014 this should be just as calming for you as it is for your little one. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll learn a thing or two about what you\u2019d like for your own bedtime routine! Be sure to allow some time before your baby\u2019s normal bedtime for the routine to take them directly to their crib. You may also choose to remove certain objects, like pacifiers, from your baby\u2019s reach or mouth during bedtime. This way, they won\u2019t wake up in the middle of the night to find the pacifier has fallen out, which can make it harder for them to fall back asleep on their own.\u00a0",

Now is also the time to begin sleep training, if you want. Sleep training consists of putting baby in their crib when they\u2019re drowsy, but not asleep, to give them the opportunity to fall asleep unassisted. If they\u2019re used to falling asleep with you, you can expect some tears. You can come back a bit later to confirm that they\u2019ve fallen asleep. While it can be difficult for both of you to transition baby into sleeping in their own space, it is important for them to become comfortable with this incremental autonomy, and realize that they won\u2019t always be right next to you. Many naps may still be occurring in the car or stroller, but it\u2019s important to begin eliminating as much motion as possible from naptime, and have them sleep in their crib for almost all naps.

While these milestones are exciting, they might also throw a wrench in your baby\u2019s sleep. The best way to help your baby manage these sleep disruptions is through consistency. Be aware though, your baby may quickly realize that this is a game \u2014 if they stand up, and your response is to rush in and sit them down, they\u2019ll know to continue to do that. Avoid this game by showing them how to sit down (instead of just picking them up) and giving them the time and space to figure it out on their own and offer plenty of opportunities throughout the day for them to explore their new skills.

Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll learn a thing or two about what you\u2019d like for your own bedtime routine! Be sure to allow some time before your baby\u2019s normal bedtime for the routine to take them directly to their crib. You may also choose to remove certain objects, like pacifiers, from your baby\u2019s reach or mouth during bedtime. This way, they won\u2019t wake up in the middle of the night to find the pacifier has fallen out, which can make it harder for them to fall back asleep on their own.\u00a0",

These napping hours are typically broken up into 3 different naps between the ages of 4-5 months, and 2 more extended naps by the time they reach their 6-month birthday. Now is also the time to begin sleep training, if you want. Sleep training consists of putting baby in their crib when they\u2019re drowsy, but not asleep, to give them the opportunity to fall asleep unassisted. If they\u2019re used to falling asleep with you, you can expect some tears. You can come back a bit later to confirm that they\u2019ve fallen asleep. While it can be difficult for both of you to transition baby into sleeping in their own space, it is important for them to become comfortable with this incremental autonomy, and realize that they won\u2019t always be right next to you. Many naps may still be occurring in the car or stroller, but it\u2019s important to begin eliminating as much motion as possible from naptime, and have them sleep in their crib for almost all naps. A baby\u2019s crib should be like their safe haven where they can move freely and sleep soundly. ",

        "description": "A consistent sleep/eat/wake schedule is crucial in helping your baby learn when it is time for food, rest, and activity. Nighttime feedings should also be fading away as baby becomes more comfortable sleeping 11-12 hours throughout the night without feedings. Because of this, it\u2019s important for your\u00a0baby to receive ample nutrients during the day, which consists of around 24 ounces total, with 5-8 ounces each feeding. If you\u2019re breastfeeding exclusively, you can make sure baby is getting enough to eat by feeding for 15-20 minutes, five times a day. Another good indicator of how much milk baby is getting each feeding is how much milk you produce when you pump. It is recommended by The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) that babies be exclusively breastfed, or formula fed, for the first 4-6 months of life, but they recognize that babies are able to accept solids between 4-6 months. Ultimately, it is up you and your baby when you begin solids, and can decide if you want to begin solids around 6 months of age, or even try them out a bit earlier. ",

As you begin to create a bedtime routine, test out various calming activities to see what works for the two of you \u2013 it\u2019s important that you also feel relaxed during this routine.

It\u2019s common for a 4-5 month old baby to have 3 naps each day, while a 6 month old will likely have 2 longer naps each day. At this age, it is now appropriate to begin sleep training, if you so desire. To do this, put your baby down to sleep when they\u2019re showing signs of sleepiness, but are not yet asleep.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be surprised if you hear some tears, as your baby may struggle as they learn to sleep without your presence. Give them some time, then come back in to check on them, and confirm that they\u2019ve found sleep. It\u2019s crucial during sleep training for your baby to be put to bed in a crib, instead of your bed, or a bedside bassinet, so your\u00a06 month old baby can have the space to move around and explore their sleeping environment. This transition can be tricky for both of you, but with time your baby will become comfortable with this new sleeping arrangement, and both of you will gain some autonomy.

To help baby achieve this full night of sleep, without needing to wake to feed, ensure they\u2019re receiving a minimum of 24 ounces of nourishment daily, with 5-8 ounces in each feeding. For exclusively breastfed babies, you can ensure they\u2019re receiving enough by feeding them at least 5 times a day for 15-20 minutes. If you\u2019re uncertain about the amount of milk your baby is receiving in each feeding, you can check the amount of milk you produce while pumping.

This transition may happen sooner if your baby has experienced a significant shift in their life, such as the introduction of a new sibling, or a move. Before transitioning to one nap, try cutting back each of the two naps to lengthen the amount of time your baby is awake between naps. If you notice your child consistently fighting their morning nap for at least two weeks, this could be a sign that it\u2019s time to phase out the morning nap. When the morning nap is dropped, it\u2019s important to remember that your baby still needs plenty of rest. Try exposing your baby to more peaceful activities throughout the day, like listening to mellow music or reading books, to encourage their body to rest, even if it\u2019s not asleep. \u00a0",

So if they haven\u2019t started solids yet, now is the time to start.",

The major shifts in their sleep habits will be that they\u2019re sleeping for longer periods during the day and night. This shift helps minimize baby\u2019s confusion between day and night. With their naps and sleep throughout the night, your baby will likely now be sleeping 14 to 16 hours a day. In addition to a sleep schedule, it\u2019s important that (if you haven\u2019t already) you begin practicing a bedtime routine with your child. You can create this routine by trying out various calming activities, like reading a book or singing a song, then sticking with the activities that do the best job at settling both you and baby \u2013 because hey, you also deserve some relaxation! Allow plenty of time for this routine and make sure to remove any distracting objects from baby\u2019s crib before laying them down for bed. ",
